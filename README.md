# Open Source Collaborative Class Materials

## Introduction

Inspired by a [github project bounty](https://github.com/Divide-By-0/ideas-for-projects-people-would-use?tab=readme-ov-file#Edtech) from [MIT Soul](https://mitsoul.org/).
This project aims to make an open-source application platform for publishing collaborative class materials, inspired by the [Missing Semester website](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/).

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Project Build / Deployment guide:

### Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve ccm-fe`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!

### Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code).

### Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

### Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

### Explore the Project Graph

Run `nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
